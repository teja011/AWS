Regions
------------
	- geographical areas 
	
Availability Zone
	- physical data center

EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud
-------------------------------------
	- provides scalable computing capacity
	- quickly provision servers/machines/instances/systems
	- scale the number of instances dynamically up or down based on requirements 
	- you can AMI to launch the instances


	Instance
		- VM / System / Server / Machine

	AMI - amazon machine image
		- OS, softwares, db

	Instance Type
		- CPU		1	2	2		
		- Memory	1	2	4	

			- general purpose
			- compute optimized
			- memory optimzied
			- graphic accelerated
			- storage optimized 
			....
	Storage 
		- Root volumne (EBS)
		- Instance store (EBS) (data will be lost on stopping instance)
		- Attached additional Volumns (EBS)

	Security Group
		- specify rules 
		- acts as a firewall
		- restrict the protocols, ports, and source IP ranges that you instance can 				serve

	**Create an EC2 Instance (Windows)
	-----------------------------
		1. select AMI
		2. Choose an Instance Type
		3. Configure Instance Details
		4. Add Storage
		5. Add Tags
		6. Configure Security Group

	**Access the Windows Instance
	-------------------------------
		- using remote desktop connection


	**Create an EC2 Instance (Linux) & access it using SSH-client
	------------------------------------------------------------

		- access using puTTY (putty.org)


	**=> default users for various linux systems 

		Amazon Linux		ec2-user
		CentOS			centos
		Fedora			fedora
		Suse			root
		
		
	**=> Execute some commands on the EC2 instance (Linux)
	--------------------------------------------------------------
		- install a web server & host a web app

			#!/bin/bash
			sudo su
			yum update -y
			yum install httpd -y
			cd /var/www/html
			echo "Welcome to my 1st Web app on EC2 Instance" > index.html
			service httpd start
			chkconfig httpd on

	Load balancer	
	----------------------
		- Distributes the traffic between the resources 
		- also performs the health checks 
			- high availability
			- fault tolerance
			- elasticity
			- Security

		- Types of LB
			1. Classic Load balancer 
				- handles traffic depending upon application or network level
			
			2. Application load balancer 
				- provides application level routing options 
				- routes the traffic based on application content spread 					across multiple services, microservices, or container 					services 
				- 

			3. Network Load balancer 
				- handles millions of requests per second 
				- works at network layer (level 4)


	Auto Scaling Groups
	-------------------------
		1. Load balancer 

		2. Launch Configuration
			- AMI?
			- instance type?
			- script/commands to be executed 
			- storage?
			- security groups?

		3. Auto Scaling Groups - ASG
			- min #
			- max #
			- scaling policy to increase/decrese
				- cloudwatch alarms/triggers


	VPC - Virtual Private Cloud
	-------------------------------
		- logically isolated / dedicated network into aws account

		- Public IP
		- Private IP
		- static IP / elastic Ip

			0.0.0.0		to 	255.255.255.255

		- CIDR block
	
			10.0.0.0/30	
				
			10.0.0.0
			10.0.0.1
			10.0.0.2
			10.0.0.3

	- subnet

	- Internet Gateway

	- Route Tables
	
	- Security Group 
		- acts as an instance level firewall
		- each SG can have max 50 separate rules for inbound/outbound 
		- one SG can be attached to more than one EC2 Instances 
		- as soon as any modification in security group rules is saved, immediately 				get appied to all associated EC2 instances
		- by default, it allows all outgoing communication and blocks all incoming
		- each rules is defined only to "allow" communication
		- SG are stateful 

	- NACL - network access control lits 
		- acts as subnet level firewall 
		- by default, blocks all inbound and outbound traffic 
		- each subnet must be associated with at least one NACL at a time 
			-** if it is not explicitely assocaited with any NACL, then it 				automatically gets associated with default NACL

		- One NACL can be associated with one or more subnets
		- NACL rules are evaluated based on its "Rule Number", lowest to highest
			** = highest number = 32766
		- separate rules to "allow" or "deny" can be created 



	Volumne types
	------------------
		General purpose SSD
		Provisioned IOPS SSD
		Cold HDD
		Throughput optimized HDD
		Magnetic





	Types of Storage	
		1. Block Storage (EBS)
		2. File Storage (EFS)
		3. Object storage (S3)
